These are some of my scripts for Pywikibot.

Most of them deal with specific stuff i've done as a Wikipedian in Residence for the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (National Library) and Nationaal Archief (National Archives) of the Netherlands.

No guarantees about the quality of the code. I'm still a learning Pythonista ;)
